<h1>LifeRemnantHighlights</h1>
Basic plugin for ExileCore2. Draws circles around Blood Mage Life Remnants to make them easier to see.
<p></p>
Also draws circles for Grim Remnants. **Note**: The circle is not technically the centre of the pickup radius, so it is possible to click the circle and sometimes not be able to reach.
<p></p>
Circles can be configured in the options.
